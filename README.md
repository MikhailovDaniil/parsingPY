# Web scraping

This is my web scraping page where I'm going to collect all my projects.

I started to learn web scraping with different videos from youtube (you can find links to them on the first line of some jupyter notebooks) in feb.2022

They helped me to learn request, [BeautifulSoup or bs4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) libraries and methods. The last one, by the way, is still my favourite.

Then I decided to try to work with scrapy which seemed to me as a very complicated way of web scraping.

I finished a course on datacamp, but it wasn't really useful in terms of scrapy. It was closer to HTML practice, however, it gave some new vision on web scraping
